# Support

This is an open source project and there is no official support as an official BBC Product. There is however a project moderator that will be overseeing the project for the foresee-able future.

## Language / Test Framework Support

At the moment support for specific test frameworks is currently limited to `php`, `phpspec`, `jasmine`, `mocha`, `rspec` and `junit`. It may work with others due to being able to parse generic `junit` xml.

If you would like support for a specific testing framework then you can either add support for this yourself and sending a pull request.

Alternatively add an issue to the `Github` space for the project and we can discuss as to how appropriate it is to add support for it.

[Visit the GitHub ShouldIT? Issue Queue](https://github.com/bbc-sport/ShouldIT/issues).

## Feature Requests

Feel free to add feature requests to the issue queue. We can then discuss with you if we feel it is appropriate and in scope for the project.

## Issues/Bugs

This software was created for use cases within BBC-Sport. You may come across occasions when bugs may surface due to your particular use case.

We will be looking at issues on Github and be addressing these as soon as we can.

## Pull Requests

We will be accepting pull requests but please remember to add `tests`. 

_Please be aware that in some cases if we feel the pull request is not in scope with the project goals then your pull request may not be merged. However all requests will be considered_

### Running Tests

Please make sure before submitting a pull request that all tests pass. Tests can be run using `mocha` command after all `npm` dependencies have been installed.
